This is a simple Python code that calculates an estimate of the remaining lifespan of a person based on their age.

Explanation of the code:
The program prompts the user to enter their age using the input() function and stores the user's response in the variable age.
The int() function is used to convert the string input of age into an integer value and store it in the variable age1.
The remaining days, weeks, and months are then calculated by subtracting the product of the user's age and the number of days/weeks/months in a year from the estimated number of days/weeks/months in a human lifespan.
Finally, the result is printed to the console using the print() function. The formatted string f"Your remaining life is {day} day , {week} week , {month} month" displays the estimated remaining lifespan of the user in days, weeks, and months based on their age.
It is important to note that this code provides only a rough estimate of one's remaining lifespan and does not take into account individual factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and health status. It is always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional for a more accurate estimate of remaining lifespan.
